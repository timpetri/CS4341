	Class for assembling a portfolio.
	
	-gather data
		-load from .csv files
	-cluster stocks (most likely 10)
		-preprocessing: de-trending, normalize by z-score
			detrended value = closing price - avg. closing price
			Zscore = detrended value / std. deviation of closing price
		-use elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters
		-perform clustering, store cluster results and cluster prototypes
	-train NN on each cluster
